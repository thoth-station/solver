    "Description": "\\$ click\\_\n==========\n\nClick is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces\nin a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the \"Command\nLine Interface Creation Kit\". It's highly configurable but comes with\nsensible defaults out of the box.\n\nIt aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun\nwhile also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to\nimplement an intended CLI API.\n\nClick in three points:\n\n-   Arbitrary nesting of commands\n-   Automatic help page generation\n-   Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    $ pip install click\n\nClick supports Python 3.4 and newer, Python 2.7, and PyPy.\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\nWhat does it look like? Here is an example of a simple Click program:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import click\n\n    @click.command()\n    @click.option(\"--count\", default=1, help=\"Number of greetings.\")\n    @click.option(\"--name\", prompt=\"Your name\",\n                  help=\"The person to greet.\")\n    def hello(count, name):\n        \"\"\"Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.\"\"\"\n        for _ in range(count):\n            click.echo(\"Hello, %s!\" % name)\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        hello()\n\nAnd what it looks like when run:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    $ python hello.py --count=3\n    Your name: Click\n    Hello, Click!\n    Hello, Click!\n    Hello, Click!\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Click and other popular\npackages.
